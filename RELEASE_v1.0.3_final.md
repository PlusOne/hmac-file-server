# HMAC File Server - Version 1.0.3 *Final*

**Release Date:** October 18, 2024

---

**Summary:**  
This release rolls back to version 1.0.3 from the previously introduced version 1.0.4. After internal testing, it was determined that version 1.0.4 introduced several overly complex and unnecessary features, which caused performance overheads and instability in certain environments.

---

**Key Changes in Version 1.0.3 (Revert Release):**
- **Reverted to stable version 1.0.3**, which offers a more balanced and reliable feature set without the excessive features introduced in 1.0.4.
- **Stable multicore processing** and **efficient HMAC validation** as seen in the 1.0.3 version.
- Features like **chunked uploads** and **multiversion file storage** have been toned down or optimized in this release for better performance.

---

**Whatâ€™s not included in this release:**
- **1.0.4 features** such as the additional chunk processing logic, aggressive retries, and extra banning mechanisms have been removed to simplify operation and reduce the CPU and memory footprint.

---

This release provides a balanced and performant HMAC file server that focuses on stability and efficiency. We highly recommend users to switch back to this version if they have experienced any issues with the 1.0.4 release.

---

**Note:**  
Version 1.0.4 will be re-evaluated for potential inclusion in a future release, but it will be subject to a more modular and opt-in design for its advanced features.

## Features
- **HMAC-based authentication** for secure file handling.
- **Multicore processing**: Efficiently utilizes multiple CPU cores.
- **File versioning**: Automatically version your files.
- **Rate-limiting and auto-banning**: Protects the server from abuse.
- **Prometheus metrics**: Monitor server performance.
- **Configurable logging**: Log to a file with support for log rotation.
  
## Download

To download the latest version of the HMAC File Server, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlusOne/hmac-file-server.git
cd hmac-file-server
go build -o hmac-file-server main.go
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file in the root directory of the project with the following settings:

```toml
# Server Configuration
ListenPort = ":8080"
UnixSocket = false
Secret = "your-secret-key"
StoreDir = "/mnt/storage/hmac-file-server/"
UploadSubDir = "upload"
LogLevel = "debug"
LogFile = "/var/log/hmac-file-server.log"

# Versioning
EnableVersioning = true
VersioningDirectory = "/mnt/storage/hmac-file-server/versions/"
MaxVersions = 2
VersioningStrategy = "timestamp"

# Retry settings
MaxRetries = 5
RetryDelay = 2
EnableGetRetries = true

# File upload settings
MaxUploadSize = 1073741824  # 1 GB in bytes
BufferSize = 65536          # 64 KB in bytes
MinFreeSpaceThreshold = 104857600  # 100 MB

# Rate limiting and banning
BlockAfterFails = 5
BlockDuration = 300
AutoUnban = true
AutoBanTime = 600

# File deletion settings
DeleteFiles = true
DeleteFilesAfterPeriod = "1y"
DeleteFilesReport = true
DeleteFilesReportPath = "/home/hmac-file-server/deleted_files.log"

# CPU usage
NumCores = "auto"

# HMAC re-asking
ReaskSecretEnabled = true
ReaskSecretInterval = "1h"

# Metrics
MetricsEnabled = true
MetricsPort = ":9090"
```

### Configuration Options

- **ListenPort**: The port on which the server listens for incoming HTTP requests.
- **UnixSocket**: Set to `true` to use a Unix socket instead of TCP.
- **Secret**: The HMAC secret used for authentication.
- **StoreDir**: The directory where files are stored.
- **UploadSubDir**: The subdirectory for uploads.
- **LogLevel**: Logging verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, etc.).
- **LogFile**: Path to the log file. If empty, logs will output to stdout.
- **Versioning**: Enable versioning and set the maximum number of versions.

## Usage

Run the server after configuring:

```bash
./hmac-file-server -config ./config.toml
```

### File Upload Example

To upload a file, use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X PUT -T filename.txt http://localhost:8080/upload/filename.txt
```

### Prometheus Metrics

If metrics are enabled, you can scrape them from the `/metrics` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

This will return standard Prometheus metrics with the `hmac_` prefix for HMAC-specific metrics.

## Logging

Logging can be configured via `config.toml`. You can specify a log file path using the `LogFile` option. By default, logs are written to `stdout`.

For log rotation, it's recommended to configure `logrotate`:

1. Create a logrotate config file (e.g., `/etc/logrotate.d/hmac-file-server`):
    ```bash
    /var/log/hmac-file-server.log {
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        copytruncate
    }
    ```

This setup will rotate logs daily, keep the last 7 days' worth of logs, and compress old logs.
